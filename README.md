# Change in Paris Ketnucky

## Development Change in the Paris, Kentucky Region

I used land cover data from **KyRaster** to look at development in the **Paris, Kentucky** region. The map shows where land changed between **2001 and 2019**, focusing on spots that went from natural or rural use to more developed urban areas.
